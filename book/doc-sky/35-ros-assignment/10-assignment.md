# Assignment {#ros-assignment status=ready}

## Creating a Publisher and Subscriber (50 points)

*Answer these questions in `ros.pdf`  and submit the ROS package you create.*

1. Read [understanding nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes).
2. Start the `screen` session we use to fly the drone. Use `rosnode list` to display what nodes are running when you start the screen. If you wish, take a look at the [software architecture diagram](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/software_architecture_intro.html) and look at all of the blue ROS topics to gain a visual understanding of all of the nodes that are running. Once again, do not worry about understanding everything now, or knowing what each topic is used for- you will learn this through experience as the course progresses. *No answer is required for this question*
3. Use `rosnode info` to find out more about as many nodes as you'd like. What topics does
   `/pidrone/infrared` publish?
4. Do the ROS tutorial to [create a package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage). Name your package `ros_assignment_pkg`.
5. Do the [building packages](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages) tutorial.

6. Follow the [ROS publisher/subscriber tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29) using the workspace and package you created above. *Hand in the entire package.*
7. Start the `screen` session we use to fly the drone. Use `rostopic echo` and `rostopic hz` to examine the results of various topics. What is the rate at which we are publishing the infrared range reading?

## Messages (5 points)

*Make all modifications in your ROS package from Problem 1 and hand in the package*

1. Read [Creating a ROS msg](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv). You do not need to read the section on services.
2. In your package from question 1, create a ROS message called `MyMessage`
   with a field for a `string`, called `name`, and a field for an array of
   `float64`, called `contents`. Edit files such as `CMakeLists.txt` to ensure
   your message is compiled and available for use. *Make these modifications in the package from problem 1 and hand it in.*

## Reading the IR Sensor (15 points)

1. Write a ROS subscriber on your drone to read the values from the infrared
   sensor topic and print them to `stdout`. *Name the file `my_echo.py` and
   submit it.*
2. Write a second ROS subscriber that listens to the infrared sensor topic and
   calculates the mean and variance over a ten second window using
   [NumPy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.02-the-basics-of-numpy-arrays.html). Print these values to `stdout`. *Name the file `mean_and_variance.py` and submit it.*
