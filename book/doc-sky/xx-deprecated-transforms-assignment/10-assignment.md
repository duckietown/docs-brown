## Translations (33 points)

A translation can be represented as a tuple $\langle x, y, z\rangle$ corresponding to the
amount a point moves in each direction. *Write the answers to the following
questions in `answers.md`.*

1. The robot is at the origin,
   $\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$. It drives forward for 5
   seconds at 2.5 meters per second. So its velocity is
   $\begin{bmatrix}0\\2.5\\0\end{bmatrix}$. How many meters has the
   robot driven, and what is its new position? Represent its new position
   as a 3-vector.

2. Assume the robot is omnidirectoral; that is it can move in any
   direction without turning.  This means we can ignore the rotation.
   The robot drives at $\sqrt{3}$ m/s for 10 s, so its velocity is
   $\begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{2}, 1, 0\end{bmatrix}$. How many meters has
   the robot driven, and what is its new position? Represent its new
   position as a 3-vector.

<!--
3. To represent translation in a transformation matrix, we add $1$ to
   the vector representing the robots position: $\langle x, y, z, 1\rangle$. To see
   why this is necessary, consider multiplying a $3\times3$ matrix $T$
   by a the vector $\langle 0, 0, 0\rangle$. Formally:
   $$
   \begin{align} T \times
   \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\ \end{bmatrix}\end{align}
   $$
   What is the result? Is it possible to represent a translation in a
   $3\times3$ matrix? If so, provide an example. If not, explain why
   not.
-->

4. To fix this problem, we add an extra entry to the position vector which is
   always $1$. Position at the origin is represented with the vector:

   $$\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}.$$

   We can represent a transformation as a matrix $T$, where
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & t_x\\
   0 & 1 & 0 & t_y\\
   0 & 0 & 1 & t_z\\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   To translate the robot, one performs the following multiplication:
   $p'= T \times p$. Where $p'$ is the position at the next timestep and $p$ is
   the position at the current timestep.

   For this problem, the robot starts at the origin. It moves right $3$ meters
   in the $x$ direction, flies up in $z$ $0.5$ meters, and then moves backward
   in the $y$ direction $1$ meter (for a net transform of $-1$ in $y$).

   4.1. Draw the robot's trajectory in three dimensions on a labeled
   coordinate frame.  You can draw it by hand and take a picture or
   scan it, or use an image editor or drawing program.  *Submit this
   picture as `trajectory.png`.*

   4.2. Write out the transformations as three separate transformation
   matrices.  Write this answer in answers.md.

   4.3. Multiply the matrices together to get one single
   transform. Write this answer in answers.md.

   4.4. Multiply the matrix by the robot's position vector to get its
   new location. Write this answer in answers.md.

## Understanding a Point Cloud (33 points)

The robot observes the following point cloud, denoted in the form $$\langle angle,
distance\rangle$$:
$$
[(0, 1), (45, 5), (90, 2), (180, 4), (270, 3)].
$$

For frame of reference, use $$0^{\circ}$$ is off to the robot's
right, $$90^{\circ}$$ is straight ahead, and $$180^{\circ}$$ is to the robot's
left.

For the following problems, assume this is all points the robot can see in the
world, so do not worry about new things that might be out of frame.

5.1. Draw a graph with the robot at $(0, 0)$ facing forward along the $y$ axis
     and draw the points that the robot sees. *Submit this graph as an image
     titled `question_5_1.png`.*

5.2. Now assume the robot drives forward one meter. Provide the new sensor
     readings, assuming perfectly accurate sensors and a perfectly accurate
     motion model. Draw them in a new version of the graph above. *Submit this
     graph as an image titled `question_5_2.png`.*

5.3. Now assume the robot rotates in place from its current location
     by 30 degrees (clockwise). Draw what it would see. *Submit this
     graph as an image titled `question_5_3.png`.*

## Robotic Arms (33 points)

A 2D linear robot has three joints as depicted below. The distance between the
first and second joint is 3m, the second and third is 5m, and the third and end
is 2m.

6.1. Implement the transformations in the skeleton code (provided in
   the GitHub Classroom), so that the arm joints move correctly and
   the base transformations are drawn. After you have implemented the
   transforms correctly, you should be able to see the arm's state as
   shown in the example image below. You should be able to move joint
   one forward and backward with 'i' and 'k', and joint two forward
   and backward with 'j' and 'l' and joint three forward and backward
   with 'a' and 'd' and see the arm update its state. We recommend
   drawing the trigonometry out on paper before implementing! When the
   joint angles are $\langle 0, 0, 0\rangle$, the arm should be pointed
   horizontally along the X axis.

6.2. Where is the arm when the joint angles are $\langle 0, 0, 0\rangle$? Give the position of
   each joint in the base coordinate system.

6.3. Provide joint angles that result in the end effector of the arm being at
   location $\langle -1, -1\rangle$.

6.4. Is the positioning in question 6.3. possible in real life? Why or why not?
