# Assignment {#safety-assignment status=ready}

The goal of this assignment is to ask you to think critically about how to
ensure robots are operated safely, and to devise guidelines for operating your
robot safely.

## OSHA Safety Analysis (50 points)

*Write your answers in `answers.txt`*

Read the OSHA Technical Manual on [Industrial Robots and Robot System
Safety](https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html).

Perform a hazard analysis for the drone, based on the OSHA guidelines. Make
sure you answer each of the following subquestions in a few sentences (in your own words).

1. What tasks will the robot be programmed to perform?

2. What are the startup, command, or programming procedures?

3. What environmental conditions are relevant?

4. What are location/installation requirements to fly the drone?

5. What are possible human errors?

6. What maintenance is necessary?

7. What are possible robot and system malfunctions?

8. What is the normal mode of operation?

## FAA Rules (20 points)
*Write the answers to these questions in the corresponding sections in `answers.txt`*

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration regulates
outdoor flight.  (It does not regulate flight indoors.)  Read the [FAA
website](https://www.faa.gov/uas/) on Unmanned Aircraft Systems.
Provide short answers to the following questions.


1. What procedures should you follow when flying your drone outside
   the CIT?  (You might find it easiest to use the [B4UFLY Smartphone
   App](https://www.faa.gov/uas/where_to_fly/b4ufly/)).

2. What is the closest airport to the CIT? Hint: Make sure to check for
   heliports as well.

3. What are some risks of drone flight? How could people get hurt with the
   robot?

4. Do you need to register your drone?

5. When do you need to report an accident to the FAA?

## Flying at Home (10 points)

*Write your answers in `answers.txt`.*

Answer the following questions about flying at home over the duration of this semester.

We understand that students may be subject to different laws pertaining to how they fly their drone, depending on where they live. We would like you to look into the local laws so you can fly your drone legally.

1. Are there any region-specific rules in your area of residence that differs from the FAA rules? Can you fly indoors in your place of residence? Is there an area nearby that you may be able to fly outside? If so, does it need pre-approval?

2. What are the risks?

3. What should you do to plan?

4. What safety precautions should you take before you fly?

## Soldering Station (10 points)

*Submit a photo with the filename `solder_station.jpg`.*

It is important for you to have a safe, well-ventilated area where you will be able to solder your electronics.

Look for a designated area in your place of residence for you to soldier, and take a picture of that area clearly showing the following:

1. Nearby a window or a ventilation fan that can suck away the smoke from the soldering iron.

2. A fire extinguisher in the vicinity; safety first!

3. A wall plug or an extension cord with surge protection, to plug in the soldering iron and fan.

4. A table to solder on! If it has a cover, make sure it is non-flammable.

## Flight Area (10 points)

*Submit a photo with the filename `fly_area.jpg`.*

In order to fly your drone (of which you definitely will in this course!), you will to think about where to fly your drone in your house. You may lose control of the drone and it might hit the ceiling or the wall; it is best to plan for those possible failiure modes, and get a large open space if possible.

Look for a designated area in your place of residence, and take a picture of that area clearly showing the following:

1. A ceiling that does not have a lot of attatchments (like dangling lights, chandeliers etc that may fall and hurt you in cases of ceiling strikes).

2. A spacious area, at least 5ft by 5ft (or 1.5m by 1.5m).

3. An area where you can instruct people to keep a safe distance while flying your drone. For example, an area right in the middle of a pedestrian street may not be a good fit since young kids from your neighborhood may come running in at any time.

## Handin

Use this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/p1OGBNg3) to access the assignment on Github classroom. Commit the
files to hand in, as you did in the Introduction assignment.

Your handin should contain the following files:

- answers.txt
- solder_station.jpg
- fly_area.jpg

If you are uncomfortable with submitting photos of your place of residence, please reach out to the TAs so that we can confirm that you will be working in a safe, non-hazardous environment for the duration of our course.
